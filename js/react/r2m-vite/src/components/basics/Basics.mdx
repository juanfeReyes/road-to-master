# Functional component
 
 The main goals a UI must succeed to be useful are: 
 - Visualization
 - Interactivity

 **Visualization**: Show the user the necessary information information to help them perform the task in the system  
 **Interactivity**: Allow the user to perform the necesary actions in the system to facilitate their experience

 React allows to write components primarily with functional sintax which is simpler than component class components

## Component lifecycle

1. Initial state setup  
  Setup all state (with useState hook) and component functions
2. Mount
  Component is rendered in browser for first time and useEffects are called just after mounting
3. Update
  Every change in state or props will trigger a rerender, running the componen body.
4. Un-mount
  Run just before the component will be removed from DOM and nor visualized

## Props and state
Every react component handles data from 2 sources:
- Props (Properties): Data send to the component sharing data or configuration parameters
- State: Internal state managed by component.

React is watching for any change in props or state to trigger an update of the component in the DOM

## Conditional Rendering
React allow us to render component and html elem based on different conditions to adapt the UI for multiple
scenarios 



## List and keys
React allows us to map a list into a collection of React components that will be rendered. This is useful
when loading several elements of the same component by only changing the props of the item component.

key property is really important as is the ID react tracks to update the state of each item in the 
rendered list

## Reuseability

#### Componsition
Composition allows to improve maintanability of component by allowing to have a 
modular structure and build specilized components which will be integrated for complex features

Usually by passing a component as a children prop

### Enhancing components

#### High order component (HOC)
HOC are functions that receive a component and return an enhanced component

#### Render props
Render props is a patter to send a function that returns a React component as a prop which allows to
enhance the prop component by the Parent component
