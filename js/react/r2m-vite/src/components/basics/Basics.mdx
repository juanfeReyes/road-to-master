# Functional component
 
 The main goals a UI must succeed to be useful are: 
 - Visualization
 - Interactivity

 **Visualization**: Show the user the necessary information information to help them perform the task in the system  
 **Interactivity**: Allow the user to perform the necesary actions in the system to facilitate their experience

 React allows to write components primarily with functional sintax which is simpler than component class components

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

## Component lifecycle

1. Initial state setup  
  Setup all state (with useState hook) and component functions
2. Mount
  Component is rendered in browser for first time and useEffects are called just after mounting
3. Update
  Every change in state or props will trigger a rerender, running the componen body.
4. Un-mount
  Run just before the component will be removed from DOM and nor visualized

## Props and state
Every react component handles data from 2 sources:
- Props (Properties): Data send to the component sharing data or configuration parameters
- State: Internal state managed by component.

React is watching for any change in props or state to trigger an update of the component in the DOM

## Conditional Rendering

## Composition

## List and keys

## Render props

## Refs advance

## Events

## High order component and best patterns
